# Memethereum Exchange (DAPP) 
Team members: Xinyi Wang, Jake Barth, Andy Wilson, Daiana Bilbao

## Summary:
We are planning on using parts of the CryptoZombies code, we will allow users to create memes and other works of art. These memes can be deployed on the ethereum test network. Meme creators can also transfer/sell their unique NFT-meme to other users. Users can also add memes as well and add captions and other content to already existing memes. 
Using a test network to trade memes using NFTâ€™s, both image and captions, and allowing creators to retain creative rights and creating a meme market. The front-end will be based on the web3 platform to interact with solidity smart contracts. To create this, the front end and back end should have a way to either upload images or claim ownership of an image and be able to link images and unique captions. 

## Motivation:
Because of the growing popularity of NFTs, we decided to join the bandwagon and create a DAPP that uses NFTs. We also wanted to create an application that will allow creators to make authentic content that can be deployed on a blockchain.

## Summary of expected complexity of project:
Because we will be using a lot of code from the most recent CryptoZombies assignment, we believe that this project will be simple enough to complete while retaining a decent challenge. This unique project will also be an enjoyable experience for all team members.

Most of the code development will involve adjusting the already existing CryptoZombies code so that it fits the needs of the project. We will also need to create a user interface for this application which will not be too difficult. 

## A list of project goals, including final expected results and how they will be reached:
Uploading images 
Setting up the tabs
Obtaining existing images using https://imgflip.com/api where we can get an array of popular memes from the internet. 
Renaming any necessary variables/classes in an existing codebase
Displaying images returned by the API on our DAPP. 
Captioning an existing image on our DAPP. (Using POST caption_image from https://imgflip.com/api)
Transferring ownership of an image
Buy/Sell functionality
Make functioning UI
